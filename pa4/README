Design

In Graph.c, functions DFS() and Visit() share one static integer variable, time,
which is defined globally to the entire file.

Graph.c is largely a copy of a previous iteration of Graph.c found in PA3.  Repeated
functions from the previous project were unchanged, or slightly
altered to fit the new needs of PA4.
